FIX THESE:
1. RATING - YOU CAN't PRESS OK FOR SOME REASON
2. booked - After a student finished booking a section, turn the section to USED after the student submitted rating. DO NOT ALLOW FOR ANOTHER BOOKING. KEEP LIKE THIS FOREVER.

3. MACHINE PAGE: Review is not working. Stars are N/A.
4. ADD A new feature for admin so that they can edit machine page.
5. Remove maintenance. It does the same thing as OUT_OF_Service
